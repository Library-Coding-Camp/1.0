						HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Despite the name, in the coding community 
					HTML is not considered a coding language since it does not implement standard coding logic. (Hence the meme on the right) 
					Still, the HTML of a website is considered a crutial part of the the website as a whole, since the HTML contains the content. 
					For example, say you wanted to add the text, “I love dogs” to your website. This task would require you to use HTML. 
					Later on, you may choose to learn Javascript (which IS considered a programming langauge in the coding community), 
					which will teach you to add interactivity to the website.
